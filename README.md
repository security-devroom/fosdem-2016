# Security Devroom @ FOSDEM'16

[FOSDEM 2016](https://fosdem.org/2016/) has, once again, a security devroom, this time on the topic of _"Security and Privacy in modern software"_. 

The security devroom will be held on **Sunday 31st of January 2016** in Brussels, Belgium at [ULB](http://www.ulb.ac.be/).

## Our topic this year

AKA "Security and Privacy in modern software"

Cryptography has been the foundation of modern crypto software, however, it is only
a small fraction of the technology required to achieve security and privacy for users.
Thus this year's topic is to focus on the other parts that make software secure: usability,
the protection against side-channels, message length analysis, fingerprinting, secure
coding practices, code review processes etc. We welcome presentations of security software
and hardware which take into account these factors, and presentations that analyze other's
solutions.

via the Pentabarf system no later than Tuesday, December 10, 2015. Suggested duration for a
